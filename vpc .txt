 1.VPC stands Virtual Private Cloud.
 
 2.Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) provides a logically isolated area of the AWS 
   cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.
   
 3.You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including a selection 
   of your IP address range, the creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.  
   
 4.You can easily customize the network configuration for your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud.

   For example, you can create a public-facing subnet for web servers that can access to the internet and can also
   place your backend system such as databases or application servers to a private-facing subnet.
   
 5.You can provide multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists, to help control 
   access to Amazon EC2 instances in each subnet.  
    
	
###################What can we do with a VPC?#######################

 1.Launch instances in a subnet of your choosing. We can choose our own subnet addressing.

 2.We can assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet.

 3.We can configure route tables between subnets.

 4.We can create an internet gateway and attach it to our VPC.

 5.It provides much better security control over your AWS resources.

 6.We can assign security groups to individual instances.
 
 7.We also have subnet network access control lists (ACLS).
