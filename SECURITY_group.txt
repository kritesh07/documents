 2.All outbound traffic is allowed automatically.
 
 3.You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group.
 
 4.You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 instance./li>
 
 5.Security groups are stateful, i.e., if you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed back out again.
