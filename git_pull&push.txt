 Git is the tool / software / program that is used to keep track of your project files. 
 it is the “version control” system, where the word “version” here refers to the changes 
 or revisions that you make to your project over time.
 
 
 GitHub, at its core, is simply a website designed to host projects that are being tracked using Git. Since it’s just a 
 “hosting service,” it’s not the only website that does this — other websites can host Git projects, such as Bitbucket, 
  though GitHub is arguably the most popular. GitHub adds on a lot of tools and views of your project that go along with 
  version control and aid with collaborating with other people on your project.


####If you dont have github account then first you have to create it on github.com after that you will have username and email.....



#####Download and install Git for Linux#########

apt-get install git


#######Configuring GitHub#########


set up the configuration details of the GitHub user.

git config --global user.name "kritesh07"

git config --global user.email "kritesh21@gmail.com"


######Creating a local repository########


#####Create a folder on your system anywhere. This will pushed onto the GitHub website########

mkdir admin

git init admin


cd admin


#####Adding repository files to an index############


######This is an important step. Here we add all the files that need to be pushed onto the website.
      These filesmight be the text file, programs, script or any document that you might add for the 
	  firsttime into the repository.....
	  

#####so, now create file for testing.....!!!!

vi admin.sh


vi sittu.sh


now we have 2 files....

admin.sh and sittu.sh


#######add it to the index by using the following 2 commands#####


	git add admin.sh

    git add sittu.sh	
	
########Committing changes made to the index###############

####A commit is a record of what files you have changed since the last time you made a commit.
    Essentially, you make changes to your repo (for example, adding a file or modifying one) and
    then tell git to put those files into a commit.
	
	
git commit -m "this is for testing"


#####Creating a repository on GitHub##########

 Create a repository on GitHub. Notice that the name of the repository should be the same as the
 repository's on the local system.
 
 Once this is created, we can push the contents of the local repository onto the GitHub repository..
 
 In this case, it will be "admin". To do this login to your account on https://github.com.
 Then click on the "plus(+)" symbol at the top right corner of the page and select
 "create new repository". Fill the details as shown in the image below and click on
 "create repository" button.
 
 
 
 Make sure you replace 'user_name' and 'admin' in the path with your Github username and folder before running the command.
 
 
 git remote add origin https://github.com/kritesh07/admin.git
 
########Pushing files in local repository to GitHub repository######


 git push origin master
 
######Enter the login credentials [user_name and password].##########

 vi admin.sh
 
 vi sittu.sh
 
 git add admin.sh
 
 git add sittu.sh
 
 git commit -m "this is for testing"
 
 git remote add origin https://github.com/kritesh07/admin.git
 
 git push origin master
 
 
 
#######Cloning  Repository################ 

  When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. 
  You can clone your repository to create a local copy on anu computer and sync between the two locations.
  
  Cloning a repository syncs it to your any local machine. After you clone, you can add and edit files and 
  then push and pull updates.
  
  
 #####first you have to add your ssh public key in github###########
 
 ssh-keygen -t rsa
 
 cd .ssh

 cat id_rsa.pub
 
 
  ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDhg7v2DrPSQlhCYwWtsGTEWRRw0na1ojTC3BzbiWbV7AlMY0dfbr3g6bM65jNeOBplD

 make directory where you want to create clone.
 
 
 mkdir hello
 
 cd hello
 
 git clone https://github.com/kritesh07/admin.git
 
 
 ######if you want create some programs or scrips then you have to just create program########
