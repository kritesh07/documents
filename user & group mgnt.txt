 User management includes everything from creating a user to deleting a user on your system. 
 User management can be done in three ways on a Linux system.
 
 1.useradd - With useradd commands you can add a user.
 
 Syntax: useradd -m -d /home/<userName> -c "<userName>" <userName>
 
 Example: useradd -m -d /home/kittu kittu
 
 File /etc/default/useradd contains some user default options. The command useradd -D can be used to display this file.
 
 useradd -D
 
 GROUP=100
 HOME=/home
 INACTIVE=-1
 EXPIRE=
 SHELL=/bin/sh
 SKEL=/etc/skel
 CREATE_MAIL_SPOOL=no
 
 
 2.userdel - To delete a user account userdel command is used.
 
 Syntax: userdel -r <userName>
 
 Example: userdel -r xyz 
 
 
 3.usermod - The command usermod is used to modify the properties of an existing user.
 
 Syntax: usermod -c <'newName'> <oldName>  
 
 Example: usermod -c 'kritesh' kittu
 
 #######Deleting Home Directories..........!!!!!!!!
 
 
 By using userdel -r option, you can delete home directory along with user account.
 
 Syntax: userdel -r <userName> 
 
 Example: userdel -r kittu
 
 
 ##########Login Shell###################
 
 The /etc/passwd file also tells about the login shell for the user.
 
 tail -10 /etc/passwd
 
 Syntax: usermod -s <newShell> <userName>
 
 Example: usermod -s /bin/bash kittu
 
 
 
 ########Linux/Unix user management commands############

 sudo passwd -l 'username'                                                         Disable a user


 sudo userdel -r 'username'                                                        Delete a user


 sudo usermod -a -G GROUPNAME USERNAME                                             Add user a to a usergroup


 sudo deluser USER GROUPNAME                                                       Remove user from a user group

finger username                                                               Gives information of a particular user



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#################Linux Group Management################################

 Users can be listed in different groups. Group allow us to set permission on the group level instead of setting the permission 
 on individual level.

 1.groupadd - The groupadd command creates or add a group in our system.
 
 Syntax:  groupadd <groupName> 
 
 Example: groupadd php
 
 ##########Group File.......!!!!!!!!!
 
 The /etc/group file defines the group membership. A user can be a member of more than one group.
 
 Syntax: /etc/group  
 
 ###########Groups################

 The group command tells about the group where current user belongs to.

 Syntax: groups

 
 2.usermod - The group members can be edited with usermod or useradd command. If a group is not listed then by default, 
             usermod command will remove the user from every group of which he is a member.
   
   Syntax: usermod -a -G <group> <userName> 
   
   Example: usermod -a -G php kittu
   
   
   
 3.groupmod - With the help of groupmod command you can change the name of an already existing group.

  Syntax: groupmod -n <oldGroup> <newGroup> 
  
  Example: groupmod -n php java
  
  

 4.gruopdel - The command groupdel will delete a group permanently from the system.

  Syntax: groupdel <group>

  Example: groupdel  php  
  
  
  
 5.gpasswd - Control of group membership can be passed on to another user with gpasswd command.

  Syntax: gpsswd -A <user> <group>

  Example: gpasswd -A kittu php  
 
 
 note: File /etc/gshadow keeps the information about the group administrators...
 
 tail -5 /etc/gshadow
 
 
 To remove all the administrators from a group, set an empty administrator list.
 
 Syntax: gpasswd -A "" <group>  
 
 Example: gpasswd -A "" java

#######################CHANGE OWNERSHIP AND PERMISSIONS ##########################

 ####Ownership of Linux files####
 
 1.User - A user is the owner of the file. By default, the person who created a file becomes its owner. 
          Hence, a user is also sometimes called an owner. 



 2.Group - A user- group can contain multiple users. All users belonging to a group will have the same access permissions to the file. 
           Suppose you have a project where a number of people require access to a file. Instead of manually assigning permissions to 
		   each user, you could add all users to a groupand assign group permission to file such that only this group members and no 
		   one else can read or modify the files.
 
 3.Other - Any other user who has access to a file. This person has neither created the file, nor he belongs to a usergroup who could
           own the file. Practically, it means everybody else. Hence, when you set the permission for others, it is also referred as set 
		   permissions for the world.
		   
		

################PERMISSIONS###########################


 1.Read - This permission give you the authority to open and read a file. Read permission on a directory gives you the ability to lists 
          its content.

 2.Write - The write permission gives you the authority to modify the contents of a file. The write permission on a directory gives you
           the authority to add, remove and rename files stored in the directory.

 
 3.Execute - In Windows, an executable program usually has an extension ".exe" and which you can easily run. In Unix/Linux, you cannot run 
             a program unless the execute permission is set. If the execute permission is not set, you might still be able to see/modify 
			 the program code(provided read & write permissions are set), but not run it.
			 
			 
			 
 NOTE: r = read permission
       w = write permission 
       x = execute permission
       - = no permission

  chown www-data:www-data kittu
  
  
  In case you want to change group-owner only, use the command.....
  
  
  chgrp group_name filename
  
  example current : chgrp root root test1
  
  after chnage : chgrp root test1
  
  
  
  chmod 775 filename or directory
